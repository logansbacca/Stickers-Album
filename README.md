## **Superhero Sticker Album (AFSE) Web Application**

***This repository contains the project work completed during my university degree as part of the course on Web and Cloud Applications. The project tackles the development of an interactive web application designed to manage digital stickers of superheroes, providing users with functionalities such as purchasing sealed sticker packs, exchanging stickers among players, and managing user profiles. The application is a demo and utilizes local storage to save stickers and user data as well as the Cache API to retrieve preloaded sticker information.***

### **Project Overview:**

The application revolves around three main scenarios:

- **User Profile Management:**
  - Allows users to register, log in, modify their profile details, and create a sticker album upon registration.

- **Sticker Pack Purchase:**
  - Involves the acquisition of virtual credits enabling the purchase of sticker packs. Each pack contains 5 randomly chosen superhero stickers, obtained using the Marvel API (https://developer.marvel.com/docs).

- **Sticker Exchange Management:**
  - Offers a space for registered users to propose exchanges of duplicate stickers for missing ones.
